# Agentic AI @UIUC Info Night

Welcome to Agentic AI @UIUC - The First Student Organization Focused on Agentic AI!

## About Us

We are the first club focused on educating students on agentic AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). We teach multi-agent architecture, voice agents, MCPs (Model Context Protocols), and how to use these technologies to solve real-world business problems.

### Gap on Campus
Most clubs talk about AI broadly or briefly, but very few focus specifically on Agentic AI, and even fewer teach it through both hands-on and hands-off learning approaches.

### Our Differentiation
We provide comprehensive education on cutting-edge agentic AI technologies, including multi-agent systems, voice agents, and Model Context Protocols, with a focus on practical business applications.

### Value to Members
- Opportunity to be surrounded by people from diverse majors and experience levels
- Work with peers from a wide range of backgrounds
- Access to exclusive projects and technical lead opportunities
- Hands-on learning with real-world applications

## Evolution of AI: Our Journey from ChatGPT to Agentic Era

### 2022: Release of ChatGPT
- Before 2022, AI was mostly hidden in recommendation and search algorithms with no consumer-facing aspect
- ChatGPT launched late 2022 and revolutionized how we interact with software and technology
- The model featured a decoder-only architecture with an estimated 175 billion parameters
- Used human learning feedback (RLHF) to improve responses through proximal policy optimization

### 2023: Multimodality & The First Glimpse of Agency
- Introduction of multi-modal capabilities
- Early signs of agentic behavior in AI systems
- Models began handling multiple types of input/output

### 2024: From Chatbots to Reasoning Engines

#### Multi-Modality
- **OpenAI's Omni Model**: Massive technical shift with a single neural network trained across text, vision, and audio
- **Google Gemini 1.5**: Introduced 1 million+ token window, allowing models to read codebases, videos, and more

#### Open Source Revolution
- **Meta's Llama 3.1 405B**: First open-source model to rival GPT-4
- **Phi-3 and Gamma**: Proved you can run high-quality AI locally on your computer

#### Reasoning Capabilities
- OpenAI released chain-of-thought reasoning models that "think" for 10-30 seconds before answering
- Coding agents like Devin and OpenDevin gained popularity

#### Video Generation
- **OpenAI's Sora**: Proved that scaling Diffusion Transformers could lead to emergent physics understanding
- **Google Veo**: Provides high output and professional cinematography capabilities

### 2025: Dawn of the Agentic Era

The current era is characterized by:
- **Peak Models**: AI capabilities reaching new heights
- **Agentic Browsers**: Autonomous agents that can navigate and interact with web interfaces
- **Protocol Standardization**: Establishment of standards like MCPs for agent communication
- **Advanced Coding Agents**: Sophisticated autonomous coding assistants

#### The Plateau of AI Models
By late 2024, researchers confirmed we had actively exhausted high-quality, human-readable training data:
- Self-attention mechanism has saturated in performance despite increasing context windows
- Frontier models require heavy energy compute, costing $1-5 billion
- **The Solution**: With base models hitting a plateau, the path forward is providing the right context around LLMs through agentic architectures
